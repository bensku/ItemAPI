#This file contains ItemAPIs UUID cache, which allows developers to use plain text
#instead of UUIDs as keys to save data to items.
#If you have moved a new world folder, which contains this file, ItemAPI automatically
#tries to merge its contents to main file in plugin folder. After that, the old file
#in world folder will OVERWRITTEN.

#DO NOT EDIT! It will definitely break all your custom items.
